# ProScSim
Process Scheduling Simulation. 

Made with Python3 and ~~hopfully PyGame~~ - NOPE. PYQT5.


Todo:
~~1. Refactor and comment proof of concept to make it easier to maintain and read.~~ - Done

~~2. Figure out how to implement this into PyGame or any other GUI.~~ - Just went with PyQt5 as I had prior experience with it.

~~3. Actually Implement this with a GUI.~~ - Done.
